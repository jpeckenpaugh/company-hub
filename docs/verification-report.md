# Verification Report — Company Hub

Stage 8 artifact. Evidence-backed pass/fail verification of the delivered
application (Stage 6 backend + Stage 7 frontend) against the approved
specifications: `concept.md`, `features/briefs/*.md`, and
`docs/architecture.md` (API contract).

- **Date:** 2026-09-02
- **Method:** live API verification via `curl` against `./run.sh` plus static
  review of frontend rendering logic (browser interaction is not automated in
  this environment). Logs and captured responses in `./tmp/verify/`.
- **Environment:** Python 3.12.14 venv (existing, reused); server started via
  `./run.sh` (`uvicorn backend.app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000`).
- **Result:** **PASS** — 0 failures. 2 checks pass with notes (documented human
  resolutions, not defects). See Limitations at the end.

| API-25 | Generated PDF is a valid, simple summary of the company's structured fields | concept, B05, §7.3 | **PASS** |

### 1.5 Frontend static review (architecture §5, B01–B05)

Static review of `frontend/` rendering logic; the exact API calls each view
makes were exercised live via `curl` (see evidence).

| FE-6 | Generate action with inline success/failure feedback (incl. the `422` "not enough information" message) | B05 | **PASS** |
| FE-7 | No client-side persistence; every view re-fetches from the API so list and profile stay consistent | §6, B01 | **PASS** |
| FE-8 | All dynamically injected text escaped (single `esc()` helper) | security | **PASS** |
| FE-9 | All five JS modules pass `node --check` | — | **PASS** |

## 2. Evidence

### 2.1 Environment / run

- `./run.sh` started the app; `GET /` → `200` and `/openapi.json` → `200`.
  OpenAPI lists all documented routes:
  `/api/artifacts/{artifact_id}`, `/api/artifacts/{artifact_id}/content`,
  `/api/companies`, `/api/companies/{company_id}`,
  `/api/companies/{company_id}/artifacts`,
  `/api/companies/{company_id}/documents/generate`.
- `data/` and `data/artifacts/` created at startup; `data/` is in `.gitignore`.

### 2.2 Company API

- `GET /api/companies` → `200`, 6 seeded companies. Sample item
  (`tmp/verify/a1-list.json`):
  ```json
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Acme Manufacturing",
    "industry": "Manufacturing",
    "hq_location": "Berlin, DE",
    "website": "https://acme.example.com",
    "contact_email": "hello@acme.example.com",
    "contact_phone": "+49 30 1234 5678",
    "description": "Industrial components and precision machining for European OEMs.",
    "created_at": "2026-09-02T03:20:36Z",
    "updated_at": "2026-09-02T03:20:36Z",
    "is_complete": true,
    "artifacts_count": 0
  }
  ```
  Shape confirmed on every item: `id` present, snake_case keys, derived
  `is_complete`, `artifacts_count`.
- Search: `?q=lumen` → `["Lumen Financial"]`; `?q=ACME` → `["Acme Manufacturing"]`
  (case-insensitive); `?q=o` → 4 substring matches; `?q=xyz` → `[]`.
- `POST /api/companies` (`tmp/verify/c1-create.json`) → `201`, returned
  `{id, name, is_complete, artifacts_count}`. Missing `name` → `422`
  (`"Field required"`); blank `name` → `422` (`"name must not be empty"`).
- `GET /api/companies/1` (`tmp/verify/b1-profile.json`) → `200` profile with
  `artifacts: []`. `GET /api/companies/999` → `404 {"detail":"Company not found"}`.
- `PUT /api/companies/9` (`tmp/verify/c4-put.json`) → `200`; fields updated,
  `updated_at` changed. Blank name → `422`; unknown id → `404`.
- Completeness (`tmp/verify/d1-incomplete.json`): company created name-only →
  `is_complete:false`; after `PUT` filling all fields → `is_complete:true`.
- `DELETE /api/companies/9` → `204`; `DELETE /api/companies/999` → `404`.
- Cascade: company 1 holding 3 artifacts deleted → `204`; `artifacts` rows for
  company 1 → 0; `data/artifacts/1/` removed from disk.

### 2.3 Artifacts / object storage

- Upload (`tmp/verify/e1-upload.json`) → `201`:
  ```json
  {
    "id": 3, "company_id": 1, "original_name": "sample.txt",
    "content_type": "text/plain", "size_bytes": 31, "source": "upload",
    "download_url": "/api/artifacts/3/content"
  }
  ```
- DB holds metadata only (`stored_filename` = UUID `5c47f75f…f8.txt`,
  `size_bytes`, `source`); bytes live on disk at
  `data/artifacts/1/5c47f75ff1e44d55b84c4c2da4e685f8.txt`. Confirms the
  structured-vs-object separation in concept.md.
- Download → `200`, `Content-Type: text/plain`, `Content-Disposition: attachment;
  filename="sample.txt"`, body matches uploaded bytes.
- Scope: company 2 artifact list → `[]` after company 1 upload (0 items leak).
- Upload to unknown company → `404`; missing `file` part → `422`.
- Delete artifact → `204`; subsequent DB row count 0 and on-disk file removed.
- Unknown artifact content/delete → `404`.

### 2.4 Document generation

- Generate for complete company 1 (`tmp/verify/f1-gen.json`) → `201`:
  ```json
  {
    "success": true, "message": "Document generated",
    "artifact": {"id": 4, "company_id": 1,
      "original_name": "Acme Manufacturing-summary.pdf",
      "content_type": "application/pdf", "size_bytes": 38925,
      "source": "generated", "download_url": "/api/artifacts/4/content"}
  }
  ```
- Downloaded PDF starts with `%PDF-1.3` (valid), served as
  `application/pdf` with attachment disposition. The artifact appears in
  `GET /api/companies/1` → `.artifacts` with `source:"generated"`.
- Incomplete company → `422` with exact failure body
  `{"success":false,"message":"Not enough information to generate a document","artifact":null}`.
- Unknown company → `404`.
- Regeneration after editing the company produced a new artifact row (total 3)
  and new bytes (39121 vs 38925), reflecting the updated description.

### 2.5 Frontend static review

- `GET /` serves the SPA shell (`<title>Company Hub</title>`).
- All static assets serve `200` with correct MIME types (CSS, JS modules,
  Bootstrap, icons, woff2 font).
- `node --check` passes for all five JS modules (`api.js`, `app.js`, `form.js`,
  `list.js`, `profile.js`).
- `api.js` maps to the documented endpoints exactly: `GET/POST /api/companies`,
  `GET/PUT /api/companies/{id}`, `POST /api/companies/{id}/artifacts`,
  `DELETE /api/artifacts/{id}`, `POST /api/companies/{id}/documents/generate`,
  plus `download_url` for content. Every one of these calls was exercised live
  above with the documented status/body shapes.
- `app.js` routes views client-side via hash (`#/`, `#/companies`, `#/companies/{id}`,
  `#/companies/new`, `#/companies/{id}/edit`) and escapes all injected text.
- No client-side persistence: each view re-fetches on render, so the list and
  profile stay consistent with backend state (Briefs 01/02).

## 3. Failures

**None.** All checks pass. No requirement failures were observed.

## 4. Notes (pass-with-note items, all previously human-resolved)

1. **API-10 — `PUT` response shape.** The contract text (§4) says `PUT` returns
   "the updated company profile shape", but the backend returns the list-item
   shape (no `artifacts` array), identical to `POST`. This was an explicit human
   resolution recorded by the Backend Engineer in Stage 6 (`summaries/06-backend.md`):
   "`PUT` returns the list-item shape (no `artifacts` array), consistent with
   `POST`, per human resolution." The SPA only consumes `id`/fields from the
   `PUT` response, so behavior is correct. Recorded as a documented deviation,
   **not a failure.**
2. **FE-10 — No delete-company UI.** The SPA intentionally exposes no
   company-delete button; deletion is left to the API/automated workflows. This
   was an explicit human resolution recorded by the Frontend Engineer in Stage 7
   (`summaries/07-frontend.md`, Q2) and is within brief scope (B03/B04 require
   add/edit and artifact removal, not company removal). The `DELETE
   /api/companies/{id}` endpoint exists and works (API-11/12). **Not a failure.**
3. **FE-11 — Generate button always enabled.** The Generate action is enabled for
   all companies, including incomplete ones; the frontend renders the backend's
   `422` failure message inline when generation is not possible. This was an
   explicit human resolution recorded in Stage 7 (Q3) and satisfies Brief 05's
   "user is told when generation succeeds or fails". **Not a failure.**

## 5. Limitations

- **Frontend browser interaction was not exercised by an automation tool** in
  this environment. The frontend was verified by static review of rendering
  logic plus live exercise (via `curl`) of every API call the SPA makes, and
  confirmation that all assets serve with correct MIME types and that all JS
  passes a syntax check. Clicking/DOM behavior was not automated.
- Search is name-only per the architecture (`?q=` on `name`), as recorded in
  Stages 6 and 7.
- Generated PDFs embed text with a Unicode font when present on the host (here
  macOS Arial Unicode), so the company text is CID-encoded and not visible as
  plaintext in the file; the PDF is valid (`%PDF-1.3`) and reflects current
  company data (byte size changes after edits).
- Testing mutated the local `data/`; it was restored to the pristine 6-company
  seeded state (0 artifacts) after verification. `data/` is gitignored.

# Sprint 01 — Verification Section

Stage 8 artifact for the Sprint 01 enhancement pass. Evidence-backed pass/fail
verification of the delivered Sprint 01 application (Stage 6 backend + Stage 7
frontend) against the approved specifications: `enhancements/scope.md`
(items a–u), `features/briefs/01-…-09-…`, and `docs/architecture.md` §8
(API contract).

- **Date:** 2026-09-04
- **Method:** live API verification via `curl` against the app (throwaway DB,
  real printed-admin-password login path), the persistent test suites under
  `tests/` (backend `pytest` + CDP headless-Chrome browser suite, orchestrated
  by `tests/run.sh`), and static review of frontend rendering logic. Logs and
  captured responses in `./tmp/verify-sprint01/`.
- **Environment:** Python 3.12.14 venv (existing, reused); server started via
  `./run.sh` with `COMPANY_HUB_DB` pointed at a throwaway DB
  (`tmp/verify-sprint01/verify.db`) so the gitignored dev `data/` remained
  untouched (verified pristine afterwards). Admin password taken from the
  console print at startup (the real scope-item-b login path).
- **Result:** **PASS** — 0 failures. 93 live `curl` checks, 51 backend `pytest`
  checks, and 34 browser automation checks all pass. See Limitations at the end.
- **Note on the v0.1 Limitations:** the v0.1 section above (2026-09-02) stated
  that browser interaction was not exercised by an automation tool. That
  limitation is **superseded** by the persistent CDP browser suite added to this
  repo; Sprint 01 frontend behavior was exercised live in headless Chrome. The
  v0.1 section is preserved unchanged.

### S1.9 Frontend (scope a/f/g/j/k/l/m/o/p, B01–B09, §8.5/§8.6)

Static review of `frontend/` rendering logic **plus** live browser automation
(CDP headless Chrome via `tests/run.sh`; the v0.1 "not automated" limitation is
superseded). Evidence: `tests/browser/` suite — 34 tests, all pass.

| # | Check | Requirement | Result |
|---|-------|-------------|--------|
| S1-FE-1 | All 7 JS modules pass `node --check`; SPA shell + CSS + JS assets serve 200 with correct MIME types | §5 | **PASS** |
| S1-FE-2 | Login view renders when unauthenticated; nav hidden; login navigates to the companies list; nav visible after; logout returns to login | a, B01 | **PASS** |
| S1-FE-3 | Country multi-select filter narrows the list (GB → HSBC/Shell), clearing restores the full list | j, B05 | **PASS** |
| S1-FE-4 | Add/edit form uses an industry dropdown (6+ choices) and carries an ADD-mode locations editor | d/f/g, B02/B04 | **PASS** |
| S1-FE-5 | Profile shows Locations/References/News/Logo sections; locations editor add/edit/remove; second-HQ error surfaced | g/k/l/o | **PASS** |
| S1-FE-6 | References add/edit/remove via UI; edit preserves "Added by admin@localhost" | k/m, B06 | **PASS** |
| S1-FE-7 | News add/edit/remove via UI; UI-created records show "Not scraped"; edits preserve the flag | l/m, B07 | **PASS** |
| S1-FE-8 | Logo upload renders inline on the profile (`<img>` decodes: `naturalWidth>0`) despite the attachment content-disposition; appears as a list thumbnail; replace swaps the image; remove renders nothing ("No logo set") | o/p, B08 | **PASS** |
| S1-FE-9 | Industry management view lists/adds/renames (no delete); rename propagates to companies | f, B03 | **PASS** |
| S1-FE-10 | SPA re-fetches on render; no client-side authoritative state; all injected text escaped | §8.6 | **PASS** |

### S1.10 Regression (scope r)

| # | Check | Requirement | Result |
|---|-------|-------------|--------|
| S1-REG-1 | v0.1 artifact upload/download/delete still works (now auth-gated) | r | **PASS** |
| S1-REG-2 | v0.1 browse/search-by-name, profile, PDF generation flows pass (live + browser suite) | r | **PASS** |
| S1-REG-3 | Seeding never overwrites user data; flush was a one-time dev-data reset (item u) | t/u | **PASS** |

## S2. Evidence

All evidence under `./tmp/verify-sprint01/` (gitignored):

- `server.log` — server startup; the auto-generated admin password printed on
  startup (scope item b), parsed and used for the real login path.
- `evidence/` — 90+ captured `curl` responses (JSON bodies, headers, the
  generated PDF `s1-doc.pdf`, the logo bytes `s1-logo-content.bin`, and the SPA
  shell `s1-root.html`).
- `verify_sprint01.py` — the live driver (93 checks, all passing).
- `tests/run.sh` output: **51** backend `pytest` checks pass (auth gate on every
  route, industries/countries/companies/locations/references/news/logos/
  documents/seed) and **34** browser tests pass (15 smoke + 19 interaction,
  incl. the Stage 8 additions for edit flows and logo upload/replace/remove +
  inline render).
- Frontend static review: `node --check` passes for all seven JS modules; all
  assets serve `200` with correct MIME types.

Selected captured responses:

- Login (`evidence/s1-login.json`): `{"id":1,"email":"admin@localhost"}` with a
  `session` cookie; wrong password → `{"detail":"Invalid email or password"}`.
- List (`evidence/s1-companies.json`): six real companies; Shell →
  `"hq_location":"London, GB"`, `industry:{...}`, `logo_url:null`,
  `is_complete:true`.
- Country filter (`evidence/s1-country-gb-fr.json`): `?countries=GB,FR` →
  `[3,5,6]`; `?countries=` → `[]`.
- Second HQ (`evidence/s1-loc-second-hq.json`): `{"detail":"Company already has
  a Headquarters"}`.
- Reference edit (`evidence/s1-ref-put.json`): `added_by`/`created_at`
  preserved, `updated_at` refreshed, title/description updated.
- Logo (`evidence/s1-logo-replace.json`): replace returns a fresh `logo` row;
  profile `logo_url` points at it; generic artifact list empty;
  `artifacts_count:0`.
- Document generate (`evidence/s1-doc-generate.json`): `201 success:true` with
  a `generated` PDF artifact; `evidence/s1-doc.pdf` is a valid `%PDF`.

## S3. Failures

**None.** All 93 live checks, 51 backend tests, and 34 browser tests pass. No
requirement failures were observed.

## S4. Notes (documented observations, not failures)

1. **Admin password test seam.** `backend/routers/auth.py` honors a
   `COMPANY_HUB_ADMIN_PASSWORD` env override when set; otherwise (the `./run.sh`
   path) it generates and prints a fresh complex password on every startup, per
   scope item b. The override is used by `tests/run.sh`/`pytest` so automated
   runs are deterministic. It is **not** described in `docs/architecture.md`
   §8.1.2/§8.8 and is an undocumented dev/test seam. The live verification used
   the real printed-password path.
2. **UK → GB mapping.** Per architecture §8.1.2 note and §8.8 note 1, the
   standard list stores `GB`/"United Kingdom"; Shell's HQ is London, GB and the
   derived `hq_location` renders "London, GB" (scope/brief text says "UK").
   Verified as intended.
3. **`?countries=` present-but-empty.** An explicitly present-but-empty
   `countries=` is an *active* filter returning `[]`; the SPA omits the
   parameter entirely when nothing is selected. Verified as intended (Stage 7
   note confirmed).
4. **Second-resolution timestamps.** `created_at`/`updated_at` are
   second-resolution; the report asserts preservation/refresh, never strict
   `created_at < updated_at`.
5. **Auth now gates content endpoints.** Unlike v0.1, `GET /api/artifacts/{id}/content`
   and every other `/api/` route require a session (scope item a); the SPA
   carries the cookie on subresource fetches, so logo `<img>` inline rendering
   works (confirmed via CDP).
6. **Logo content-disposition.** Logo/artifact downloads set
   `Content-Disposition: attachment`; browsers render `<img>` subresource
   fetches inline regardless. Confirmed in headless Chrome (`naturalWidth > 0`).
7. **Browser automation supersedes the v0.1 limitation** (see header note).

## S5. Limitations

- Live `curl` checks ran against a throwaway DB
  (`tmp/verify-sprint01/verify.db`) to keep the gitignored dev `data/` pristine;
  `data/` was confirmed unchanged afterwards.
- Browser automation runs headless Chrome via `tests/run.sh` against its own
  throwaway DB with a fixed admin password (env override). The Sprint 01 UI
  flows (login, country filter, industry management, locations/references/news
  add/edit/remove, logo upload/replace/remove, inline logo render) are covered;
  visual styling/PDF pixel rendering was not asserted.
- The browser suite and `pytest` are the persistent suites in this repo and
  remain the ongoing regression guard; this section records their results for
  the sprint.

# Sprint 02 — Verification Section

Stage 8 artifact for the Sprint 02 enhancement pass. Evidence-backed pass/fail
verification of the delivered Sprint 02 application (Stage 6 backend + Stage 7
frontend) against the approved specifications: `enhancements/scope.md`
(items a–o), `features/briefs/01-…-06-…`, and `docs/architecture.md` §9
(API contract). The pass rebuilt persistence on async SQLAlchemy with Alembic
migrations and replaced the hand-rolled auth with the maintained fastapi-users
library (stateful `DatabaseStrategy` + `CookieTransport`).

- **Date:** 2026-09-05
- **Method:** (1) the persistent backend `pytest` suite (throwaway temp DBs),
  (2) the persistent CDP headless-Chrome browser suite via `tests/run.sh`, and
  (3) live `curl` checks against a running app (throwaway DB, fixed admin
  password, short-`TTL` server for expiry) exercising the fastapi-users auth
  contract plus a non-auth API regression pass. Logs and captured responses in
  `./tmp/verify-sprint02/`.
- **Environment:** Python 3.12.14 venv; server started via
  `uvicorn backend.app:app` with `COMPANY_HUB_DB` pointed at throwaway DBs
  (`tmp/verify-sprint02/live.db`, `tmp/verify-sprint02/expiry.db`) and
  `COMPANY_HUB_ADMIN_PASSWORD` fixed, so the gitignored dev `data/` was never
  touched (confirmed clean afterwards).
- **Result:** **PASS** — 0 failures. 64 backend `pytest` checks, 36 CDP browser
  checks, and 28 live `curl` checks all pass. See Notes and Limitations at the
  end.

## S2.1 Checklist derivation

### S2.1.8 Frontend (scope g, B03/B04/B05, §9.3–§9.6)

Static review of `frontend/` rendering logic **plus** live browser automation
(CDP headless Chrome via `tests/run.sh`; the v0.1 "not automated" limitation is
superseded by the persistent suite). Evidence: `tests/browser/` suite — 36 tests
(16 smoke + 20 interaction), all pass, including a change-password UI flow.

| # | Check | Requirement | Result |

## S2.2 Evidence

All evidence under `./tmp/verify-sprint02/` (gitignored):

- `live/server.log`, `expiry/server.log` — server startup logs for the two
  throwaway-DB runs.
- `live/` — captured `curl` responses for the auth contract and regression pass:
  `non_auth.json`, `bad_login.json`, `unknown_login.json`, `login.json`,
  `me.json`, `me_anon.json`, `post_logout.json`, `cp_ok.json`, `cp_old.json`,
  `cp_new.json`, `cp_wrongold.json`, `cp_short.json`, `create_alice.json`,
  `create_dup.json`, `alice_login.json`, `alice_me.json`,
  `alice_create.json`, `regr_create.json`, `regr_search.json`, `up.json`,
  `dl.bin`, `gen.json`, cookie jars, and `server.log`.
- `expiry/` — `login.json`, `expired.json`, `me_expired.json`, cookie jar, and
  `server.log` (short-TTL run).
- `tests/run.sh` output: **64** backend `pytest` checks pass (16 auth incl.
  password change, multiple users, and session expiry via backdated
  `created_at`, plus all non-auth route/resource tests) and **36** browser
  tests pass (16 smoke + 20 interaction, incl. the change-password UI flow).

Selected captured responses:

- Login (`live/login.json`): `{"access_token":"…","token_type":"bearer"}` with an
  HttpOnly `session` cookie; `live/bad_login.json` →
  `{"detail":"LOGIN_BAD_CREDENTIALS"}`.
- `me` (`live/me.json`): `{"id":1,"email":"admin@localhost","is_superuser":true}`.
- Change-password (`live/cp_ok.json`): `{"status":"ok"}`; after the change
  `live/cp_old.json` → `400 LOGIN_BAD_CREDENTIALS` and `live/cp_new.json` →
  `200`; wrong old (`live/cp_wrongold.json`) → `400 INVALID_PASSWORD`.
- Admin creation (`live/create_alice.json`): `201
  {"id":2,"email":"alice@example.com","is_superuser":false}`; duplicate
  (`live/create_dup.json`) → `400 REGISTER_USER_ALREADY_EXISTS`;
  non-superuser (`live/alice_create.json`) → `403 {"detail":"Not enough
  permissions"}`.
- Session expiry: with `COMPANY_HUB_SESSION_TTL=2`, login set `Max-Age=2`
  (observed in `expiry/server.log` Set-Cookie evidence), `/api/companies` → 200
  within lifetime and → `401 {"detail":"Not authenticated"}` after 3 s
  (`expiry/expired.json`); `/api/auth/me` → `401` (`expiry/me_expired.json`).
- Server-side revocation: `access_tokens` count dropped 5 → 4 immediately after
  logout (live DB inspection).
- Schema (`live.db`): `oauth_accounts` table present with 0 rows; `users` has
  `password_hash`, `is_active`, `is_superuser`, `is_verified`.
- Regression: `regr_create.json` → `201` full Sprint 01 shape; `?q=Toyota` →
  `["Toyota Motor"]`; artifact upload → `201` and download → `200` attachment
  with identical bytes; document generate → `201 success:true`.

## S2.3 Failures

**None.** All 64 backend tests, 36 browser tests, and 28 live `curl` checks
pass. No requirement failures were observed; in particular, no non-auth
regression was found (all deliberate changes were confined to auth and the
persistence layer underpinning it).

## S2.4 Notes (documented observations, not failures)

1. **Fastapi-users contract deviations (architecture §9.2.1).** Login uses a
   JSON body (`{email, password}`) and returns `200 {access_token,
   token_type}` rather than the stock form-encoded flow; logout returns `204`
   even with no session (idempotent); `me` returns `{id, email, is_superuser}`.
   All three are the documented, deliberate deviations recorded by the Backend
   Engineer in Stage 6 and verified as delivered.
2. **Session expiry is verified live via the documented `COMPANY_HUB_SESSION_TTL`
   override** (short TTL on a throwaway DB), with the default 7-day lifetime
   asserted by the cookie `Max-Age`/TTL match and the pytest expiry test
   (backdated `created_at`). The default TTL itself (7 days) is not waited out
   live.
3. **Admin-password test override.** The fixed `COMPANY_HUB_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
   used for deterministic live/browser runs is the same documented dev/test
   seam as Sprint 01 (see Sprint 01 note 1); the app's documented runtime path
   is the console-printed stable password created once and persisted
   (superseding Sprint 01's per-startup regeneration).
4. **`is_superuser`/`is_active`/`is_verified` columns.** The `users` table now
   carries the fastapi-users flags; only `{id, email, is_superuser}` is exposed
   in the `me` payload (architecture §9.1.1/§9.8 n.7). Verified as intended.
5. **Session tokens persist server-side.** The stateful `DatabaseStrategy`
   stores each token in `access_tokens` with `lifetime_seconds`; this is the
   mechanism satisfying scope item h (server-side lifetime + revocation), not a
   stateless JWT strategy (architecture §9.8 n.1).
6. **PATCH /api/auth/me is declared but the password-only self-service path is
   `POST /api/auth/change-password`.** In scope, the only self-update field is
   the password via the change-password route; other profile fields are out of
   scope (architecture §9.2.1). Verified via the change-password contract.

## S2.5 Limitations

- Live `curl` checks ran against throwaway DBs
  (`tmp/verify-sprint02/live.db`, `tmp/verify-sprint02/expiry.db`) to keep the
  gitignored dev `data/` pristine; `data/` was confirmed unchanged afterwards.
- The 7-day default session lifetime is not waited out live; expiry is
  demonstrated via a short `COMPANY_HUB_SESSION_TTL` and supported by the
  pytest expiry test.
- Browser automation runs headless Chrome via `tests/run.sh` against its own
  throwaway DB with a fixed admin password. The Sprint 02 UI change
  (self-service change-password) is covered; visual styling/PDF pixel rendering
  was not asserted.
- The browser suite and `pytest` are the persistent suites in this repo and
  remain the ongoing regression guard; this section records their results for
  the sprint.
